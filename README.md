# DentalStaff

## Overview

A friendly website that helps you find dental staff for your clinic when you need them the most. You can find doctors, hygienist, dental assistants, chairside assistants, receptionists and more! Psst... you can also offer your services here!

### Problem Space

Admin side: Dental offices are highly dependent on a fully staffed team to operate efficiently. When a team member, whether a dentist, dental hygienist, assistant, or receptionist, is unexpectedly unavailable due to illness, holiday, or personal reasons, the office faces a significant challenge. This often leads to appointment cancellations, overworked staff, reduced patient satisfaction, and lost revenue. Current methods of finding temporary or replacement staff are slow, unreliable, and often involve costly staffing agencies or frantic last-minute phone calls.

Staff side: As a dental professional, your skills are in high demand, but finding flexible opportunities that fit your schedule can be challenging. Whether you're looking to pick up extra shifts, fill gaps in your schedule, or explore different practices, thereâ€™s a need for a more efficient way to connect with dental offices in need of temporary or short-term staff.
